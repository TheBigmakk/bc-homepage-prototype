# Beyond Condition – Homepage Prototype

This repository is a **reference prototype** for the Beyond Condition website pivot.

Purpose:
- Encode a **product-first** homepage (the app is primary).
- Position consultancy as **secondary credibility and SEO**, not the core offer.
- Treat Community (templates, tools, subreddit) as a **first-class growth surface**.

This is **not** production code.
It is a disposable spec to guide the real implementation.

Key principles:
- No “choose your path” landing page.
- Home page assumes a product company by default.
- Consultancy is visible but clearly secondary.
- Copy and hierarchy matter more than styling.

See `index.html` for the intended homepage structure and copy.
